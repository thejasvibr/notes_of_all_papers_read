*Adaptive echolocation sounds in the bat Rhinopoma hardwickei* [@habersetzer1981adaptive]

- *Notes taken on 2020-07-22 (TO BE COMPLETED!!)*

- *Rhinopoma hardwickei* behaviour studied as they emerge from their caves. 

## Methods 
- Speed of the bat flight measured with a stroboscipic camera
- Echolocation calls recorded with a B & K microphone placed at the cave entrance. 
- *R. hardwickei* lives relatively close to the cave entrance, and are found with other batr species too. The bats flew at an altidtude of around 10-15metres above the ground
- Bats began to return to their roosts around 3:00-3:30 in the morning, but most of them returned later between 4:30-5:45 am. 

## Results
-  The author showed (i guess for the first time then) that *R. hardwickei* can actually modulate its echolcoation calls, ie. by showing that the calls change over the course of a landing from classical quasi-CF to vey FM
- During emergence, bats only emitted FM calls of ~3ms duration
- Emerging clusters seemed to have a preferred direction, while single bats that flew out didn't seem to have any preferred flight direction 
- Single bats also seemed to emit CF type calls, in contrast to bats that were flying in groups 
- Groups of bats sometimes formed over foraging grounds and in the early morning at the cave entrance itself. The bats in these groups emitted CF type calls. 
- INdividual bats in these groups seemed to emit calls t unique CF frequencies
