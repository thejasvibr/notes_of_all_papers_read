# What this book is about {-}
This book is a compilation of all the notes I will be making for the papers that I read from now. 
I've been realising my paper notes are scattered everywhere, across multiple folders and multiple computers, 
this is my attempt at trying to unify everything into one place. 

# How build the book after each new chapter addition
If in RStudio, with the correct R environment in place, then:

1. Open the ```index.Rmd``` file
1. 'Session-->Build all'
1. Both the pdf and html file formats should automatically be compiled one after the other.
