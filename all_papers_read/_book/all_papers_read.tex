\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  map based navigation goes beyond just simple modes eg. beacon following or landmark based navigation.
\item
  bats are known to return to their normal sites even after displacement, which suggests `map-and-compass' navigation style
\item
  Authors' previous results showed that fruit bats flew straight paths, but this was limited to a few nights of data.
\item
  In this study, authors managed to study 172 bats over a cumulative of 3449 nights.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \emph{ATLAS} - a reverse GPS system, where the animal wears a tag that emits a signal which is received by multiple ground stations - and thus using TOADs, the animal can be detected.
\item
  ATLAS coverage region is \textasciitilde88,200 hectares (or an area that's 29X29km big!!)
\item
  bats tagged, and all fruit trees within a given region recorded.
\item
  Also performed translocation experiments. Each bat was translocated to the periphery of its normal foraging area, but within detection range of their foraging area
\item
  Also performed time-lag embedding to understand how complex the navigational mechanism is
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bats exhibited straight tracks, which is indicative of goal-directed behabiou
\item
  Each bat had its favourite tree, and visited it every night, and even visited it from multiple directions of arrival
\item
  Solid evidence for a cognitive map is when an animal moves between two points that can't be detected/seen/observed from each other (ie. it requires a kind of `rigorous' mapping)
\item
  4.3\% of all tracks,and 70/172 bats actually showed such shortcuts
\item
  There was no difference in the rate at which shortcuts happened between the age groups of bats tagged
\item
  \emph{following a conspecific} -- they talk about it by saying that in their dataset, they didn't see individuals flying close together - but they only tagged 172 bats of ??? thousand in the whole population
\item
  Translocated bats were able to return to their normal foraging area
\item
  Time-lag embedding showed a high-dimensional correlation (?) indicating there must be many difference navigational factors

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If bats were following a simple navigational route, they might always arrive and depart from the same direction - but the authors don't see this.
  \item
    Authors don't seem convinced about the idea of an olfactory map
  \item
    Authors also rule out the idea of pure path integration because they show that many bats returned to a different cave than the one they started out the evening from

\section{Introduction, Methods, Results}\label{introduction-methods-results}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Whether animals navigate using 'maps'or not remains a question. The ability to take shortcuts, or direct routes between two points is a hallmark of map based navigation.
\item
  The main problem with studying animal namvigation in the wild is that we can never be sure that the animal has not taken an apparent `shortcut' before.
\item
  authors were able to GPS track 22 young Egyptian Fruit Bats (\emph{Rousettus aegeyptiacus}) from their first flight out of the roost
\item
  Young bats increased their home range over the course of \textasciitilde70 nights, by which they had the same home range size as an adult.
\item
  Individuals showed two types of broad flight behaviour over a night, `exploratory', where they explored for new trees, and nights where they visited prviously visted trees.
\item
  Evidence to support the fact that the shortcuts were intentional:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    shortcut were as straight as familiar routes (`commutes')
  \item
    individuals seem to head in the direction of their target from the start of the `shortcut'
  \item
    the `shortcuts' could not be replicated by a random correlated walk (\emph{this seems like a bit of a straw man null model (\href{https://www.fharrell.com/post/nhst-never/}{link}), especially since the data is clearly so directional. The authors also specifically mention `but without any navigational goal'})
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Bats performed both shortcuts and long-cuts from their first day outside,} - this is pretty impressive, but this also makes me think that the bats may actually be relying on a kind of path integration. Is their apatial memory so good that they can start mapping things over the course of one night? Is it possible that the bats may actually be using a beacon-type stategy to find their way around?
\item
  Authors rule out olfaction and sound based cues by comparing wind direction and actual recordings made on the backpack tags. Both don't show support.
\item
  \emph{`Bats that were closer to the translocation release point before the translocation night did not necessarily navigate home better, once again contradicting the template-matching hypothesis'} , the authors also go on to follow and say that bats that flew higher were better able to find their way back. This actually doesn't rule out the template matching hypothesis either, because it might just mean that bats that flew higher had larger access to the area below, to form a `higher SNR' template perhaps\ldots{}
\item
  The authors do also admit that the navigation behaviou they observed may be a result of multiple navigation strategies: \emph{`\ldots, navigation is a complex behavior that probably does not always rely on a single strategy'}
\item
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comments}{%
\subsection{Comments}\label{comments}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  `How animals navigate over large-scale environments remains a riddle', first line of the abstract starts with a rather bold statement. Is this statement really true for all animals, am under the impression that there is a large body of work for at least some animals.
\item
  `\emph{We documented how young pupsdeveloped their visual-based map}' - interesting, does this mean, echolocation develops later, or that the bats are known to use primarily vision for their navigation?
\item
  Remember listening to a talk by Lee Harten in Konstanz ASAB, where she also presented work on the flight behaviour of the mother, who carried her pups around, and how the mother used to leave the pup in one tree, and so on. Do the authors discuss the implications of this type of memory on the shortcut taking ability of the young bats? \emph{Yes, the authors have taken care of this, in the SI, they clearly state the mother and the pups were brought into an indoor facility, and the pups were kept indoors until they could fly}
\item
  \emph{What about bats flying together?}, or encountering each other? Their inhourse colony data kind of excludes this idea because the individual bats arrive alone, and are spaced b a few minutes. This is not the most rigorous evidence, but is still pretty indicatibe, eg. even in Orlova Chuka (and other caves), you can see the bats arrive alone in the morning. Howeer, this still doesn't really exclude the fact that bats may be encountering each other at some point over the course of the night.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  weird animal behaviour just before earthquakes habe been reported, including dramatic cases where snakes and rats came out of their winter burrows during the winter in the 1975 Haicheng earthquake
\item
  finding reliable changes in animal behaviour is tough because animal the animal behaviour needs to be monitored before and during the earthquake.
\item
  Authors were able to overcome some of the limitations in the data this time by tagging multiple farm animals with high-resolution GPS tags that were equipped with many types of sensors

  ``Warning times'' ranged from 1-15 hours

  \emph{notes taken on 2020-07-21}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  echolocation is pretty flexible and the emitted calls vary a lot based on the type of prey being caught, and the presence of conspecifics
\item
  This paper is a kind of offspring of another (Avila-Flores 2003), where the authors saw that there was more call variation when bats flew together than when alone.
\item
  Authors try to estimate this variation by comparing observed pairs of bat calls and `virtual' pairs of bat calls.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Free flying \emph{Tadarida brasiliensis} recorded in three locations in Mexico City, of bats flying over a lake, and two others in open areas (park and city square)
\item
  30 sequences from each location obtained (15 single bat passes + 15 paired passes).
\item
  Authors specifically chose call sequences with no overlap of bat calls.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To compare the single vs paired call behaviour, the difference in the mean values was used
\item
  The difference in the mean, \(\Delta_{mean}\) was used to compare if a bat showed alterations to its echolocation when alone vs.~when with another bats.
\item
  To understand if bats actually altered their call parameters when flying in groups the authors calculated the pair difference \(bat1_{measurement}-bat2_{measurement}\) for actual observed pairs of bat call sequences, and those of virtual pairs.
\item
  The pair difference was calculated by subtracting the means of the \(bat1_{measurement}\) and \(bat2_{measurement}\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors didn't find any statistical difference in call parameters across locations and so decided to pool them all together (and thus used single bat call sequences from multiple locations while making virtual pairs). (\emph{See comments})
\item
  Authors found no inter-individual call differences across observed and virtual pairs for the parameters 1) call duration 2) bandwidth , and found differences in the peak frequency. (\emph{See comments})
\item
  The authors also saw social calls in paired audio files.
\item
  The authors are indeed careful while ending `\emph{To be even-handed\ldots.changes in peak frequency which we found\ldots are neither jamming avoidance nor air traffic control, but serve another and as yet undetermined communicative function}'
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comments}{%
\subsection{Comments}\label{comments}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  authors state \emph{`Although referred to as jamming avoidance.., support for this interpretation is not as strong as that for the jamming avoidance response in electric fish'}. They also go on to state that labortatory studies seem to have `met with some success'. In general, does this support the fact that bats in the field may actually not be showing dramatic changes in calls at all - it's only when they're put into a quiet unusual lab context that they begin to show changes. Perhaps, this strong response is seen because the animals have gotten used to flying under quiest conditions, and are now suddenly challenged?
\item
  how do the authors actually know that the two bats in a paired call sequence were flying together/in close proximity? `\emph{We assinged each recorded seequence to one of two situations\ldots..and two bats flying close proximity}' - this is a rather vague definition. With a single bat detector, it is not possible to track the bats in 3d, at most one can check if the waveforms of the two bat calls are similar, but here too it only means that the two bats were flying in the same radius from the bat detector. It is somewhat crude, though admittedly, the best possible criteria given the current instrument.
\item
  Authors actually pooled call sequences from multiple locations and made virtual call pairs from this pool. This will actually have the effect of \emph{increasing} the diversity of the observed data? Also, it is known from tracking studies that individual bats tend of have favourit foraging sites - and so in some sense, it is expected that there will be a `local' flavour to the data. It would have been nice to see the authors perform the same analysis without pooling across locations.
\item
  The authors find differences in peak frequency between real and virtual pairs. This could really be an effect of where the bats were flying while in pairs vs when they were alone. The simplest explanation is that the bats may be flying further away from the microphone, thus leading to different SNRs at recording - which then leads to different peak frequencies. The difference in the peak frequency could really be an artifact and not a real effect. Moreover, given the authors state that they do see social calls, the line between social call and echolocation call is a thin one, which means, perhaps the authors are seeing this effect? The authors state this themselves \emph{`Our recordings suggest a continuum in call features between echolocation and social calls\ldots{}'}
\item

\emph{Magnetic alignment enhances homing efficiency of hunting dogs} \citep{benediktova2020magnetic}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Notes taken on 2020-07-22}
\item
  `homing' behaviour has been shown in many animals, and could be driven by multiple cues. Homing behaviour in non-migratory species still needs to be excplored more.
\item
  Reports of dogs that found their way back even when displaced beyond their usual home range, and without access to familiar visual cues.
\item
  Hunting dogs have been bred by humans to chase game and then return to the start point if not followed by the hunter. These `hunts' can ve a few hundreds to thousands of meter long.
\item
  These dogs may find their way back either using their own scent trail - which the authors called `tracking' or, by actually navigating using the landmarks or information gained during the onward travel, which the authors call `scouting'
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The hunting dogs were left to innately follow the olfactory tracks of game animals in the wildlife reserve
\item
  Small dogs were used, and so there was no `physical threat' to wild animals
\item
  All dogs were tagged with GPS collars, and some of the trials with dogs also had a camera involved.
\item
  Trials were performed with single dogs, and in areas free of high voltage power lines, roads or buildings and across the day and season (across the year)
\item
  There needs to be some more clarity in terms of when a trial started (see \emph{Comments})
\item
  Owners hid behind a tree to reduce visual beaconing
\item
  Only excursions \textgreater200 metres were considered for this study
\item
  Authors split all excursions into 10 equal parts, and assigned phases to them based on the average speed of the part.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{return-strategies}{%
\subsection{Return strategies}\label{return-strategies}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dog return strategies could be categorised into two classes

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    tracking: the inbound and outbound trajectory are the same , and the inbound-outbound trajectories were \textless30 m apart
  \item
    scouting: a new woute was taken, and the inbound-outbound trajectories were \textgreater30 m apart
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  in \textasciitilde59\% of all trials, dogs ended up tracking their way back, while in 33\% of the trials, dogs ended up scouting their way back, and in 8\% of the trials, dogs used a mic of scouting and tracking
\item
  Scouting dogs showed a higher average speed while returning (because they tended to take shorter routes)
\item
  Trials bbegan and ended with no particular bias in the compass directions, though trials which were in the north-south axis, showed more efficient homing runs
\item
  wind direction and sun location didn't seem to make a difference
\item
  dogs returning with a scouting strategy seemed to begin by first travelling along the north-south axis, irrespective of the actual location of the destination
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors convincingly rule out the possibility of multiple cues begin used(vision, olfaction, celestial cues). Thedogs are too short to see far, and the forest is pretty opaque. Olfactory cues are likely to change a lot, though one can't rule it out completely
\item
  The sun's location/polarised light -- this they haven't been fully able to elimination - but they indicate that there were trials where the sun wa blocked by clouds - which would reduce the strength of polarised light `map'
\item
  Authors do highlight the fact that path integration is definitely one possible mechanism by which the dogs in this tudy may be finding their way back, but the question of the north-south run still remains - and it may in fact serve as a kind of recalibration run, over which the errors accumulated over path integration can somehow be `corrected'?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{overall-thoughts-comments}{%
\section{Overall thoughts / Comments}\label{overall-thoughts-comments}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Really smoth introduction - easy to follow
\item
  It's not entirely clear how the trial exactly proceeded. The dogs were brought to a site, and then left to roam free.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{The handheld GPS device was programmed to indicate when the dog had travelled ≥100 m from the position of the owner. At this moment (designated as `excursion start') the owners stopped walking\ldots{}}. This is the confusing part, because, what was the owner doing before that? Were the dog and the owner walking together (unleashed dog) on a trail, and then when the dog roamed far away enough, the trial was considered started. But this still elaves some room for error in terms, of wehere the dog left the `main trail' and where the owner was when the trial started\ldots..confusing
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In figure 4, bottom plot - authors plot the \emph{log} of the inbound track length against the raw beeline difference. This is a bit misleading perhaps? In general, yes, the log-transform will tend to show lesser variation - but in general, there will always be a linear correlation between te distance the animal travelled and the beeline distance \ldots especially if there is some kind of navigation in place\ldots{} - am I being over-cautious here or not - can't make out.
\item
  Pretty cool study, this study ads to the general observation of so many magnetically related behaviours (dogs peeing/pooping facing one direction (where did i read this), arctic foxes always facing one stereotyped direction before ponching onto their prey underneath the snow, and cows facing in one direction while grazing)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Speed of the bat flight measured with a stroboscipic camera
\item
  Echolocation calls recorded with a B \& K microphone placed at the cave entrance.
\item
  \emph{R. hardwickei} lives relatively close to the cave entrance, and are found with other batr species too. The bats flew at an altidtude of around 10-15metres above the ground
\item
  Bats began to return to their roosts around 3:00-3:30 in the morning, but most of them returned later between 4:30-5:45 am.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The author showed (I guess for the first time then) that \emph{R. hardwickei} can actually modulate its echolocation calls, ie. by showing that the calls change over the course of a landing from classical quasi-CF to very FM
\item
  During emergence, bats only emitted FM calls of \textasciitilde3ms duration
\item
  Emerging clusters seemed to have a preferred direction, while single bats that flew out didn't seem to have any preferred flight direction
\item
  Single bats also seemed to emit CF type calls, in contrast to bats that were flying in groups
\item
  Groups of bats sometimes formed over foraging grounds and in the early morning at the cave entrance itself. The bats in these groups emitted CF type calls.
\item
  Individual bats in these groups seemed to emit calls with unique CF frequencies (Fig. 4 bottom), in contrast to single bats which seem to emit at a common frequency band while flying alone (Fig. 5)
\item
  The bats seem to split thei CF frequencies into 3 bands, 30, 32.5 and 35 kHz.
\item
  \textbf{R. hardwickeii} Cf calls don't seem to have an iFM or tFM unlike rhinolophids. The author seuggests this might mean that these bats are getting time delay purely through the envelpe of the call itself. I'm also fascinated by how the laryngeal mechanism must differ between the two species. Here, the absence of a FM to start/end means the bat must release the pressure uniformly over a very short period of time.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Authors measure the source levels of a whole community of horseshoe bats near and around the Tabachka field station. They record call levels of 5 species.
\item
  The CF distributions of the four-five species that geographically overlap in Europe, also overlap spectrally
\item
  \emph{Rhinolophus mehelyi} can tell apart conspecific calls in the midst of other overlapping species (See comments)
\item
  Do some bats (that are calling at higher than allometrically predicted frequencies) evolve towards a `private frequency' channel?
\item
  Authors look at whether \emph{R. mehelyi} produce louder calls to compensate for decrease in detection distance because they call at a higher call frequency for their given body size (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 2})
\item
  The questions the authors ask are:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Are the call intensitites different across species, and could call intensities play a role in nice differentiation (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 3})
  \item
    Does \emph{R. mehelyi}, the higher-than-allometrically predicted species, call at `especially high' call intensities? (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 4})
  \item
    How does max. call intensity vary with body size, sex -- and could it be used as an honest signal bats can use to identify conspecifics (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 5})

  A low p-value can thus be a result of a high effect size for a given sample size, or a very large sample size for a given small effect size. So, how does one go about disentangling this issue then?? Perhaps with power analyses -- which then adds to the amount of work that needs to be done anyway..?
\item
  the p-value is not stable\ldots hmm, even across replicates - this is kind of scary to know. ie. in \citep{halsey2015fickle}, they state \emph{`The reason for this is that unless statistical power is very high, the P value exhibits wide sample-to-sample variability and thus does not reliably indicate the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis'}, and \emph{`If statistical power is limited, regardless of whether the P value returned from a statistical test is low or high, a repeat of the same experiment will likely result in a substantially different P value'}
\item
  Not sure how different this simplified Bayes factor is from a p-value - I also don't understand how it overcomes the problems associated with dichotomous type p-value testing. Moreover, if the p-value itself is `fickle', then it will also result in unstable SIB estimates too -- how to overcome this problem\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  In cluttered environments, echoes that arrive after the next call can cause call-echo ambiguity.
\item
  When interpulse interval (IPI) is \textgreater{} `echo-epoch' (time taken for the last echoes in the acoustic scene to arrive, \(\alpha\) `depth' of the scene) - then there is no ambiguity
\item
  Echoes from the previous call that arrive can appear to be objects that are very close by.
\item
  However, in cluttered conditions, bats reduce their IPI to keep up the update rate, which means the chance of such ambiguities is higher.
\item
  `Frequency hopping' helps to overcome this call-echo matching problem.
\item
  \emph{Eptesicus fuscus} shows shifts of upto 5-7 kHz between one call to the next while doing this kind of echo hopping. However, even a shift of 5-7 kHz means an overlap of 70-80\% from one call to the other (\protect\hyperlink{com_ming}{Comments 1})

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The authors seem to discuss the implications of the last few kilohertz results into how frequency hopping works -- they haven't actually shown this directly through the experiments. The data only says the last few kilohertz is important for echo delay detection.
\item
  The results indicate that the last few kilohertz is important - but at the same time don't point to a mechanism which allows the bat to detect echoes which are frequency shifted - how would the bat register the fact that the `terminal frequency' has moved up after it's shifted its echolocation? This is not really discussed in the paper directly ?..

\section{the SCAT model}\label{the-scat-model}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the SCAT model is a bio-inspired model which aims to mimic how the auditory system of bats work.
\item
  delay perception is done by parallel bandpass filters which detect the time between sounds with energy in their bandpass region. Thus, they are able to tell the delay between call and echo fairly accurately.
\item
  The idea the authors propose is essentially that the lower part of each call is the one that triggers echo detection.
\item
  Imagine one call with terminal frequency at 20 kHz, and the next call with the terminal frequency at 25 kHz. Even if an echo from the previous call were to arrive - it'd have much lower frequencies than that of the current - call and wouldn't be `sent' into the processing chain.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How is this overlap actually calculated - it can be done in multiple ways\ldots including/excluding the second harmonics etc..? As the authors themselves mention later - a shift of 5-7 kHz in the first harmonic corresponds to a shift of 10-14 kHz in the second harmonic.
\item
  Fig. 2 is the first figure that is referred in the paper (and the one that brings the phenomenon to the reader directly) - but, Fig.1 (related to a more technical point) is presented first - could have been rearranged.
\item
  S+ is introduced without any kind of explanation, and the figure is the main reference for the paper. This is kind of understandable given the word limits, but it's also kind of unfortunate because the reader's flow is interrupted each time by having to go back and forth between sections of the paper.
\item
  I'm not able to understand why the authors trained the bats to distinguish two echoes that differ in two characteristics. Am wondering how this would affect what can actualy be said from the experiments. ie. the results could also be narrowly interpreted to say, `bats require the lowest parts of their FM1 to tell apart a double glint echo from a single glint echo' \ldots{} It would have been cleaner if the authors had actually compared the bats ability to tell apart two echoes with the same structure, but arriving at different delays -- this would actually say something about what is required to detect an echo, rather than a double glint vs a single glint echo. The task is made \emph{easier} by the introduction of such different properties \emph{`..question is whether this easy task still is easy (sic) if the lowest fre quencies in FM1 are removed from the S+ echoes'}, but the point is that it may also muddle the interpretation?
\item
  There seems to be a disconnect between what was done and what is being discussed. What was shown is that the end frequencies are important for echo discrimination (the glint structure X different delays confuses things according to me). But what is being discussed is how the frequency hopping is reliant on the lower frequencies of each call - the authors haven't really `shown' this experimentally - but suggest a model which may explain it. There's something that I can't put into words better - need to give this a second try again.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Take a case where people are randomly assigned into two groups, and two unrelated dependent variables are measured. The groups are compared. True positive of no effect on both the variables is: 0.95 X 0.95 = 0.9025. Probability of at least one of the variables showing up as significantly different is: 1 - 0.9025 = \textbf{0.0975} !! How to control such erroneous false positives?
\item
  There are a bunch of methods which can control the `error rates':

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Bonferroni correction
  \item
    Holm-Bonferroni sequential procedure
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  When the \# of statistical tests increase, it may be better to control false discovery rate, rather than error rates.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Bonferroni correction}\label{the-bonferroni-correction}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{`The Bonferroni correction controls the familywise error rate..'} \protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{\emph{what is family wise error rate - See} Comments}
\item
  \emph{`..is not straight forward is that error control does not just aim to control the number of erroneous statistical inferences, but the number of erroneous theoretical inferences.'}. Is the author trying to say that corrections need to be done when a bunch of tests are trying to answer the same question, with a common dataset - don't fully understand
\item
  Experiment wise Type I error rates (\emph{I guess this is the famous p value?}) can be calculated from the setup of the stats? The example given by the author here is in a 2x2x2 ANOVA (See \protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{Comments 2}) - there are seven tests that are done, and so when a 0.05 \(\alpha\) is used each time, this make the probability of getting at least one effect at least 30\%. \emph{(\protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{Comments 3})}
\item
  The author also gives a more experimental example. The case of comparing predictions from two theories. One theory predicts interaction in a 2x2 ANOVA, and the other doesn't predict an interaction, but at least one main effect. (A 2x2 ANOVA tests 3 null hypotheses, two main effects and one interaction).\\
\item
  A naive way to approach the Bonferroni correction is to set the \(\alpha\) to \(\frac{\alpha}{3}\)
\item
  But here the author points out that because theoretically the two theories predict different outcomes, the \(\alpha\) also needs to corrected separately. Since Theory B predicts at least one significant main effect (out of 2 main effects) - we can set the new \(\alpha\) to \(\alpha /2\) and so if the p \textless{} \(\alpha/2\) we will accept Theory B
\item
  Since Theory A predicts only one interaction being significant, we don't really need to correct for anything. (\protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{Comments 4})
\item
  Maintaining a sensible \(\alpha\) value with multiple testing corrections allows you to be wrong at most at the expected \(\alpha\) rate.
\item
  Should you correct for all the tests you will do over your lifetime? Yes, but only if all the data/work you've done is going into testing one single theory !
\item
  \emph{`..criticism on corrections for multiple comparisons is that it is strange that the conclusions a researcher draws depends on the number of additional tests a researcher performs.'} - here the authors cites the case of a 2 group comparison being significant at 0.05 (p=0.04), but when including a second dependent variable, the \(\alpha\) is now 0.025, which means the first variable data no longer rejects the null hypothesis. ..\emph{`Lowering alpha levels is a mathematical necessity when you want to control error rates, but it is not needed if ..you..quantify relative likelihoods of the data under different hypotheses.'}. Does the author mean that the comparison of the two groups for each of the dependent variables corresopnds to two independent null hypotheses? In what way is this different from the 2x2x2 ANOVA that was just discussed before?
\item
  You can also increase the alpha, and sometimes this makes sense to do so - ie. while pre-registering two studies, you can set the alpha at 0.2236, and decide that only if \emph{both} studies show \(p<0.2236\) will the null hypothesis be rejected. This is effectively the same as setting the overall \(p\) at 0.05 because 0.2236X0.2236 = 0.05 - {[}Comments 5{]}
\item
  \emph{`There is only one reason to calculate p-values, and that is to control Type 1 error rates using a Neyman-Pearson approach.'} - the focus here is on controlling false positives.

\item
  what is a `familywise error rate': The probability of making at least on Type I error (False Positive): \(FWE \leq 1-(1-\alpha_{test})^{Number\ of\ comparisons}\). eg. at an \(\alpha\) of 0.05 and with 10 tests, the \(FWE\) is : \(\leq (1-0.05)^{10}=0.401\) (thanks to this \href{https://www.statisticshowto.com/familywise-error-rate/}{page})
\item
  2x2x2 ANOVA is when there are three variables and two groups in each variable. ie. imagine you're testing a drugs efficacy, and you have three variables (Thanks to this \href{https://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/7/statistics/stat_what_is_three-way_anova_used_f.htm}{page}) : sex, dosage level and treatment/control. Within Sex there's male and female, within dosage level there's high and low, and then there's treatment/control. There are seven p-values because it performs a series of comparisons within the 2x2x2 complex:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    3 tests comparing the groups within each of the variables (eg. male vs female, treatment vs control, high vs low)
  \item
    3 tests testing two-way interactions: pool data from Sex, effect of treatment vs control in low and high dose groups
  \item
    1 test on three way interaction: \emph{`there is no three way interaction among all three factors'}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I get this example, within one statistical test, there are seven comparisons being made - and when each of these have an alpha value, there can be a false positive - what about when you are performing single comparisons of multiple variables from two groups?
\item
  I guess one of the main issues that the author is trying to bring out is that by naively correcting and setting \(\alpha\) values very low, we risk running into Type II (false negative) errors! By setting
\item
  What would have happened if the alpha was still set at 0.05 for both studies, then the effective false positive rate would have been 0.025 -- which is perhaps too conservative? Also, with an alpha set at 0.2236, the probability of a false negative is:
