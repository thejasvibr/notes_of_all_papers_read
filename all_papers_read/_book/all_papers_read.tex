I've been realising my paper notes are scattered everywhere, across multiple folders and multiple computers,
this is my attempt at trying to unify everything into one place.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  map based navigation goes beyond just simple modes eg. beacon following or landmark based navigation.
\item
  bats are known to return to their normal sites even after displacement, which suggests `map-and-compass' navigation style
\item
  Authors' previous results showed that fruit bats flew straight paths, but this was limited to a few nights of data.
\item
  In this study, authors managed to study 172 bats over a cumulative of 3449 nights.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \emph{ATLAS} - a reverse GPS system, where the animal wears a tag that emits a signal which is received by multiple ground stations - and thus using TOADs, the animal can be detected.
\item
  ATLAS coverage region is \textasciitilde88,200 hectares (or an area that's 29X29km big!!)
\item
  bats tagged, and all fruit trees within a given region recorded.
\item
  Also performed translocation experiments. Each bat was translocated to the periphery of its normal foraging area, but within detection range of their foraging area
\item
  Also performed time-lag embedding to understand how complex the navigational mechanism is
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bats exhibited straight tracks, which is indicative of goal-directed behabiou
\item
  Each bat had its favourite tree, and visited it every night, and even visited it from multiple directions of arrival
\item
  Solid evidence for a cognitive map is when an animal moves between two points that can't be detected/seen/observed from each other (ie. it requires a kind of `rigorous' mapping)
\item
  4.3\% of all tracks,and 70/172 bats actually showed such shortcuts
\item
  There was no difference in the rate at which shortcuts happened between the age groups of bats tagged
\item
  \emph{following a conspecific} -- they talk about it by saying that in their dataset, they didn't see individuals flying close together - but they only tagged 172 bats of ??? thousand in the whole population
\item
  Translocated bats were able to return to their normal foraging area
\item
  Time-lag embedding showed a high-dimensional correlation (?) indicating there must be many difference navigational factors

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    If bats were following a simple navigational route, they might always arrive and depart from the same direction - but the authors don't see this.
  \item
    Authors don't seem convinced about the idea of an olfactory map
  \item
    Authors also rule out the idea of pure path integration because they show that many bats returned to a different cave than the one they started out the evening from

\section{Introduction, Methods, Results}\label{introduction-methods-results}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Whether animals navigate using 'maps'or not remains a question. The ability to take shortcuts, or direct routes between two points is a hallmark of map based navigation.
\item
  The main problem with studying animal namvigation in the wild is that we can never be sure that the animal has not taken an apparent `shortcut' before.
\item
  authors were able to GPS track 22 young Egyptian Fruit Bats (\emph{Rousettus aegeyptiacus}) from their first flight out of the roost
\item
  Young bats increased their home range over the course of \textasciitilde70 nights, by which they had the same home range size as an adult.
\item
  Individuals showed two types of broad flight behaviour over a night, `exploratory', where they explored for new trees, and nights where they visited prviously visted trees.
\item
  Evidence to support the fact that the shortcuts were intentional:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    shortcut were as straight as familiar routes (`commutes')
  \item
    individuals seem to head in the direction of their target from the start of the `shortcut'
  \item
    the `shortcuts' could not be replicated by a random correlated walk (\emph{this seems like a bit of a straw man null model (\href{https://www.fharrell.com/post/nhst-never/}{link}), especially since the data is clearly so directional. The authors also specifically mention `but without any navigational goal'})
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Bats performed both shortcuts and long-cuts from their first day outside,} - this is pretty impressive, but this also makes me think that the bats may actually be relying on a kind of path integration. Is their apatial memory so good that they can start mapping things over the course of one night? Is it possible that the bats may actually be using a beacon-type stategy to find their way around?
\item
  Authors rule out olfaction and sound based cues by comparing wind direction and actual recordings made on the backpack tags. Both don't show support.
\item
  \emph{`Bats that were closer to the translocation release point before the translocation night did not necessarily navigate home better, once again contradicting the template-matching hypothesis'} , the authors also go on to follow and say that bats that flew higher were better able to find their way back. This actually doesn't rule out the template matching hypothesis either, because it might just mean that bats that flew higher had larger access to the area below, to form a `higher SNR' template perhaps\ldots{}
\item
  The authors do also admit that the navigation behaviou they observed may be a result of multiple navigation strategies: \emph{`\ldots, navigation is a complex behavior that probably does not always rely on a single strategy'}
\item
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comments}{%
\subsection{Comments}\label{comments}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  `How animals navigate over large-scale environments remains a riddle', first line of the abstract starts with a rather bold statement. Is this statement really true for all animals, am under the impression that there is a large body of work for at least some animals.
\item
  `\emph{We documented how young pupsdeveloped their visual-based map}' - interesting, does this mean, echolocation develops later, or that the bats are known to use primarily vision for their navigation?
\item
  Remember listening to a talk by Lee Harten in Konstanz ASAB, where she also presented work on the flight behaviour of the mother, who carried her pups around, and how the mother used to leave the pup in one tree, and so on. Do the authors discuss the implications of this type of memory on the shortcut taking ability of the young bats? \emph{Yes, the authors have taken care of this, in the SI, they clearly state the mother and the pups were brought into an indoor facility, and the pups were kept indoors until they could fly}
\item
  \emph{What about bats flying together?}, or encountering each other? Their inhourse colony data kind of excludes this idea because the individual bats arrive alone, and are spaced b a few minutes. This is not the most rigorous evidence, but is still pretty indicatibe, eg. even in Orlova Chuka (and other caves), you can see the bats arrive alone in the morning. Howeer, this still doesn't really exclude the fact that bats may be encountering each other at some point over the course of the night.

  weird animal behaviour just before earthquakes habe been reported, including dramatic cases where snakes and rats came out of their winter burrows during the winter in the 1975 Haicheng earthquake
\item
  finding reliable changes in animal behaviour is tough because animal the animal behaviour needs to be monitored before and during the earthquake.

  \emph{notes taken on 2020-07-21}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  echolocation is pretty flexible and the emitted calls vary a lot based on the type of prey being caught, and the presence of conspecifics
\item
  This paper is a kind of offspring of another (Avila-Flores 2003), where the authors saw that there was more call variation when bats flew together than when alone.
\item
  Authors try to estimate this variation by comparing observed pairs of bat calls and `virtual' pairs of bat calls.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Free flying \emph{Tadarida brasiliensis} recorded in three locations in Mexico City, of bats flying over a lake, and two others in open areas (park and city square)
\item
  30 sequences from each location obtained (15 single bat passes + 15 paired passes).
\item
  Authors specifically chose call sequences with no overlap of bat calls.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To compare the single vs paired call behaviour, the difference in the mean values was used
\item
  The difference in the mean, \(\Delta_{mean}\) was used to compare if a bat showed alterations to its echolocation when alone vs.~when with another bats.
\item
  To understand if bats actually altered their call parameters when flying in groups the authors calculated the pair difference \(bat1_{measurement}-bat2_{measurement}\) for actual observed pairs of bat call sequences, and those of virtual pairs.
\item
  The pair difference was calculated by subtracting the means of the \(bat1_{measurement}\) and \(bat2_{measurement}\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors didn't find any statistical difference in call parameters across locations and so decided to pool them all together (and thus used single bat call sequences from multiple locations while making virtual pairs). (\emph{See comments})
\item
  Authors found no inter-individual call differences across observed and virtual pairs for the parameters 1) call duration 2) bandwidth , and found differences in the peak frequency. (\emph{See comments})
\item
  The authors also saw social calls in paired audio files.
\item
  The authors are indeed careful while ending `\emph{To be even-handed\ldots.changes in peak frequency which we found\ldots are neither jamming avoidance nor air traffic control, but serve another and as yet undetermined communicative function}'
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comments}{%
\subsection{Comments}\label{comments}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  authors state \emph{`Although referred to as jamming avoidance.., support for this interpretation is not as strong as that for the jamming avoidance response in electric fish'}. They also go on to state that labortatory studies seem to have `met with some success'. In general, does this support the fact that bats in the field may actually not be showing dramatic changes in calls at all - it's only when they're put into a quiet unusual lab context that they begin to show changes. Perhaps, this strong response is seen because the animals have gotten used to flying under quiest conditions, and are now suddenly challenged?
\item
  how do the authors actually know that the two bats in a paired call sequence were flying together/in close proximity? `\emph{We assinged each recorded seequence to one of two situations\ldots..and two bats flying close proximity}' - this is a rather vague definition. With a single bat detector, it is not possible to track the bats in 3d, at most one can check if the waveforms of the two bat calls are similar, but here too it only means that the two bats were flying in the same radius from the bat detector. It is somewhat crude, though admittedly, the best possible criteria given the current instrument.
\item
  Authors actually pooled call sequences from multiple locations and made virtual call pairs from this pool. This will actually have the effect of \emph{increasing} the diversity of the observed data? Also, it is known from tracking studies that individual bats tend of have favourit foraging sites - and so in some sense, it is expected that there will be a `local' flavour to the data. It would have been nice to see the authors perform the same analysis without pooling across locations.
\item
  The authors find differences in peak frequency between real and virtual pairs. This could really be an effect of where the bats were flying while in pairs vs when they were alone. The simplest explanation is that the bats may be flying further away from the microphone, thus leading to different SNRs at recording - which then leads to different peak frequencies. The difference in the peak frequency could really be an artifact and not a real effect. Moreover, given the authors state that they do see social calls, the line between social call and echolocation call is a thin one, which means, perhaps the authors are seeing this effect? The authors state this themselves \emph{`Our recordings suggest a continuum in call features between echolocation and social calls\ldots{}'}
\item

\emph{Magnetic alignment enhances homing efficiency of hunting dogs} \citep{benediktova2020magnetic}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Notes taken on 2020-07-22}
\item
  `homing' behaviour has been shown in many animals, and could be driven by multiple cues. Homing behaviour in non-migratory species still needs to be excplored more.
\item
  Reports of dogs that found their way back even when displaced beyond their usual home range, and without access to familiar visual cues.
\item
  Hunting dogs have been bred by humans to chase game and then return to the start point if not followed by the hunter. These `hunts' can ve a few hundreds to thousands of meter long.
\item
  These dogs may find their way back either using their own scent trail - which the authors called `tracking' or, by actually navigating using the landmarks or information gained during the onward travel, which the authors call `scouting'
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The hunting dogs were left to innately follow the olfactory tracks of game animals in the wildlife reserve
\item
  Small dogs were used, and so there was no `physical threat' to wild animals
\item
  All dogs were tagged with GPS collars, and some of the trials with dogs also had a camera involved.
\item
  Trials were performed with single dogs, and in areas free of high voltage power lines, roads or buildings and across the day and season (across the year)
\item
  There needs to be some more clarity in terms of when a trial started (see \emph{Comments})
\item
  Owners hid behind a tree to reduce visual beaconing
\item
  Only excursions \textgreater200 metres were considered for this study
\item
  Authors split all excursions into 10 equal parts, and assigned phases to them based on the average speed of the part.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{return-strategies}{%
\subsection{Return strategies}\label{return-strategies}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dog return strategies could be categorised into two classes

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    tracking: the inbound and outbound trajectory are the same , and the inbound-outbound trajectories were \textless30 m apart
  \item
    scouting: a new woute was taken, and the inbound-outbound trajectories were \textgreater30 m apart
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  in \textasciitilde59\% of all trials, dogs ended up tracking their way back, while in 33\% of the trials, dogs ended up scouting their way back, and in 8\% of the trials, dogs used a mic of scouting and tracking
\item
  Scouting dogs showed a higher average speed while returning (because they tended to take shorter routes)
\item
  Trials bbegan and ended with no particular bias in the compass directions, though trials which were in the north-south axis, showed more efficient homing runs
\item
  wind direction and sun location didn't seem to make a difference
\item
  dogs returning with a scouting strategy seemed to begin by first travelling along the north-south axis, irrespective of the actual location of the destination
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors convincingly rule out the possibility of multiple cues begin used(vision, olfaction, celestial cues). Thedogs are too short to see far, and the forest is pretty opaque. Olfactory cues are likely to change a lot, though one can't rule it out completely
\item
  The sun's location/polarised light -- this they haven't been fully able to elimination - but they indicate that there were trials where the sun wa blocked by clouds - which would reduce the strength of polarised light `map'
\item
  Authors do highlight the fact that path integration is definitely one possible mechanism by which the dogs in this tudy may be finding their way back, but the question of the north-south run still remains - and it may in fact serve as a kind of recalibration run, over which the errors accumulated over path integration can somehow be `corrected'?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{overall-thoughts-comments}{%
\section{Overall thoughts / Comments}\label{overall-thoughts-comments}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Really smoth introduction - easy to follow
\item
  It's not entirely clear how the trial exactly proceeded. The dogs were brought to a site, and then left to roam free.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{The handheld GPS device was programmed to indicate when the dog had travelled ≥100 m from the position of the owner. At this moment (designated as `excursion start') the owners stopped walking\ldots{}}. This is the confusing part, because, what was the owner doing before that? Were the dog and the owner walking together (unleashed dog) on a trail, and then when the dog roamed far away enough, the trial was considered started. But this still elaves some room for error in terms, of wehere the dog left the `main trail' and where the owner was when the trial started\ldots..confusing
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In figure 4, bottom plot - authors plot the \emph{log} of the inbound track length against the raw beeline difference. This is a bit misleading perhaps? In general, yes, the log-transform will tend to show lesser variation - but in general, there will always be a linear correlation between te distance the animal travelled and the beeline distance \ldots especially if there is some kind of navigation in place\ldots{} - am I being over-cautious here or not - can't make out.
\item
  Pretty cool study, this study ads to the general observation of so many magnetically related behaviours (dogs peeing/pooping facing one direction (where did i read this), arctic foxes always facing one stereotyped direction before ponching onto their prey underneath the snow, and cows facing in one direction while grazing)

  Speed of the bat flight measured with a stroboscipic camera
\item
  Echolocation calls recorded with a B \& K microphone placed at the cave entrance.
\item
  \emph{R. hardwickei} lives relatively close to the cave entrance, and are found with other batr species too. The bats flew at an altidtude of around 10-15metres above the ground
\item
  Bats began to return to their roosts around 3:00-3:30 in the morning, but most of them returned later between 4:30-5:45 am.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The author showed (I guess for the first time then) that \emph{R. hardwickei} can actually modulate its echolocation calls, ie. by showing that the calls change over the course of a landing from classical quasi-CF to very FM
\item
  During emergence, bats only emitted FM calls of \textasciitilde3ms duration
\item
  Emerging clusters seemed to have a preferred direction, while single bats that flew out didn't seem to have any preferred flight direction
\item
  Single bats also seemed to emit CF type calls, in contrast to bats that were flying in groups
\item
  Groups of bats sometimes formed over foraging grounds and in the early morning at the cave entrance itself. The bats in these groups emitted CF type calls.
\item
  Individual bats in these groups seemed to emit calls with unique CF frequencies (Fig. 4 bottom), in contrast to single bats which seem to emit at a common frequency band while flying alone (Fig. 5)
\item
  The bats seem to split thei CF frequencies into 3 bands, 30, 32.5 and 35 kHz.
\item
  \textbf{R. hardwickeii} Cf calls don't seem to have an iFM or tFM unlike rhinolophids. The author seuggests this might mean that these bats are getting time delay purely through the envelpe of the call itself. I'm also fascinated by how the laryngeal mechanism must differ between the two species. Here, the absence of a FM to start/end means the bat must release the pressure uniformly over a very short period of time.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bats of one species seem to show echolocation in a `common frequency band', ie. all measured bats calling within a 3kHz bandwidth
\item
  Schnitzler 1968 found a max of 2.5kHz deviation across \emph{R. ferrumequinum} and \emph{R. euryale}
\item
  Three species recorded in a cave in Kenya were however found to show `sub-bands' with no individuals calling in between two main call frequencies.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This species also showed a bimodal distribution of CF at either 79 or 88 kHz
  \item
    \emph{Here it gets interesting!} When individual animal call traces were placed over each other, then the calls seemed to be somewhat continuously spaced. But when a group of bats were flown together, bats seems to emit calls clearly in one of two sub-bands
  \item
    Fig. 2 -- could the difference in the `combined frequency profile' vs individual frequencies just be a function of flight speed. Maybe when the bats are palced together in a cage, they tend to overall fly a bit faster/slower -- leading to this difference in the emitted frequencies by individuals?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Authors measure the source levels of a whole community of horseshoe bats near and around the Tabachka field station. They record call levels of 5 species.
\item
  The CF distributions of the four-five species that geographically overlap in Europe, also overlap spectrally
\item
  \emph{Rhinolophus mehelyi} can tell apart conspecific calls in the midst of other overlapping species (See comments)
\item
  Do some bats (that are calling at higher than allometrically predicted frequencies) evolve towards a `private frequency' channel?
\item
  Authors look at whether \emph{R. mehelyi} produce louder calls to compensate for decrease in detection distance because they call at a higher call frequency for their given body size (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 2})
\item
  The questions the authors ask are:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Are the call intensitites different across species, and could call intensities play a role in nice differentiation (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 3})
  \item
    Does \emph{R. mehelyi}, the higher-than-allometrically predicted species, call at `especially high' call intensities? (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 4})
  \item
    How does max. call intensity vary with body size, sex -- and could it be used as an honest signal bats can use to identify conspecifics (\protect\hyperlink{com_shuchsiem}{Comments 5})

\item
  There;s a large variation in the frequency resolution across the years. It also is a bit unclear whether the authors used an automatic or manual method -- though my current reading seems to suggest a semi-manual method to estimate the peak frequency of a call

  authors suggest call intensity can be an informative cue that can be used to assess species identity. They propose that perching bats may be able to reconstruct the position and `head-aim' of the other bat, and thus assess its source-level. \emph{While it may be informative to tell apart }R. mehelyi*, which calls fainter than others - there may actually be other cues eg. FM sweeps, or even more `voice' type characteristics embedded in the whole call that could be picked up by bats themselves?)

\item
  The p value has been used and abused, and in some sense has contributed to the reproducibility crisis in science

  A low p-value can thus be a result of a high effect size for a given sample size, or a very large sample size for a given small effect size. So, how does one go about disentangling this issue then?? Perhaps with power analyses -- which then adds to the amount of work that needs to be done anyway..?
\item
  the p-value is not stable\ldots hmm, even across replicates - this is kind of scary to know. ie. in \citep{halsey2015fickle}, they state \emph{`The reason for this is that unless statistical power is very high, the P value exhibits wide sample-to-sample variability and thus does not reliably indicate the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis'}, and \emph{`If statistical power is limited, regardless of whether the P value returned from a statistical test is low or high, a repeat of the same experiment will likely result in a substantially different P value'}
\item
  Not sure how different this simplified Bayes factor is from a p-value - I also don't understand how it overcomes the problems associated with dichotomous type p-value testing. Moreover, if the p-value itself is `fickle', then it will also result in unstable SIB estimates too -- how to overcome this problem\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In cluttered environments, echoes that arrive after the next call can cause call-echo ambiguity.
\item
  When interpulse interval (IPI) is \textgreater{} `echo-epoch' (time taken for the last echoes in the acoustic scene to arrive, \(\alpha\) `depth' of the scene) - then there is no ambiguity
\item
  Echoes from the previous call that arrive can appear to be objects that are very close by.
\item
  However, in cluttered conditions, bats reduce their IPI to keep up the update rate, which means the chance of such ambiguities is higher.
\item
  `Frequency hopping' helps to overcome this call-echo matching problem.
\item
  \emph{Eptesicus fuscus} shows shifts of upto 5-7 kHz between one call to the next while doing this kind of echo hopping. However, even a shift of 5-7 kHz means an overlap of 70-80\% from one call to the other (\protect\hyperlink{com_ming}{Comments 1})

\item
  In \emph{E. fuscus}, the first harmonic is required for echoes need to have a first harmonic to be `registered', but the second harmonic (FM2) plays a stronger role in modulating echo delay perception.

  The authors seem to discuss the implications of the last few kilohertz results into how frequency hopping works -- they haven't actually shown this directly through the experiments. The data only says the last few kilohertz is important for echo delay detection.
\item
  The results indicate that the last few kilohertz is important - but at the same time don't point to a mechanism which allows the bat to detect echoes which are frequency shifted - how would the bat register the fact that the `terminal frequency' has moved up after it's shifted its echolocation? This is not really discussed in the paper directly ?..

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the SCAT model is a bio-inspired model which aims to mimic how the auditory system of bats work.
\item
  delay perception is done by parallel bandpass filters which detect the time between sounds with energy in their bandpass region. Thus, they are able to tell the delay between call and echo fairly accurately.
\item
  The idea the authors propose is essentially that the lower part of each call is the one that triggers echo detection.
\item
  Imagine one call with terminal frequency at 20 kHz, and the next call with the terminal frequency at 25 kHz. Even if an echo from the previous call were to arrive - it'd have much lower frequencies than that of the current - call and wouldn't be `sent' into the processing chain.

\begin{enumerate}

\tightlist
\item
  How is this overlap actually calculated - it can be done in multiple ways\ldots including/excluding the second harmonics etc..? As the authors themselves mention later - a shift of 5-7 kHz in the first harmonic corresponds to a shift of 10-14 kHz in the second harmonic.
\item
  Fig. 2 is the first figure that is referred in the paper (and the one that brings the phenomenon to the reader directly) - but, Fig.1 (related to a more technical point) is presented first - could have been rearranged.
\item
  S+ is introduced without any kind of explanation, and the figure is the main reference for the paper. This is kind of understandable given the word limits, but it's also kind of unfortunate because the reader's flow is interrupted each time by having to go back and forth between sections of the paper.
\item
  I'm not able to understand why the authors trained the bats to distinguish two echoes that differ in two characteristics. Am wondering how this would affect what can actualy be said from the experiments. ie. the results could also be narrowly interpreted to say, `bats require the lowest parts of their FM1 to tell apart a double glint echo from a single glint echo' \ldots{} It would have been cleaner if the authors had actually compared the bats ability to tell apart two echoes with the same structure, but arriving at different delays -- this would actually say something about what is required to detect an echo, rather than a double glint vs a single glint echo. The task is made \emph{easier} by the introduction of such different properties \emph{`..question is whether this easy task still is easy (sic) if the lowest fre quencies in FM1 are removed from the S+ echoes'}, but the point is that it may also muddle the interpretation?
\item
  There seems to be a disconnect between what was done and what is being discussed. What was shown is that the end frequencies are important for echo discrimination (the glint structure X different delays confuses things according to me). But what is being discussed is how the frequency hopping is reliant on the lower frequencies of each call - the authors haven't really `shown' this experimentally - but suggest a model which may explain it. There's something that I can't put into words better - need to give this a second try again.
\item
  The authors don't show the actual double glint echo - which is somewhat odd too.

(Leonie leading, and other group members commenting)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  As the authors state, when the low pass is at 20kHz -there should be no
  double glint echo (silence on one side), which means the bats only choose the double glint,
  instead of just reverting to the side with one echo. This seems kind of odd
\item
  The bat could actually be using frequency based cues, rather than
  the delay
\item
  Not so many experimental details - a supplementary information could have been included
\item
  The results only say that the last few kilohertz is important for telling apart S- and S+ - it doesn't necessarily
  say whether this part plays a role in glint enumeration (single vs double) or delay acuity!
\item
  Authors haven;t really shown that in general the last few kilohertz aer important between calls, but the authors here have only shown that
  25-30 kHz is important.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Take a case where people are randomly assigned into two groups, and two unrelated dependent variables are measured. The groups are compared. True positive of no effect on both the variables is: 0.95 X 0.95 = 0.9025. Probability of at least one of the variables showing up as significantly different is: 1 - 0.9025 = \textbf{0.0975} !! How to control such erroneous false positives?
\item
  There are a bunch of methods which can control the `error rates':

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Bonferroni correction
  \item
    Holm-Bonferroni sequential procedure
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  When the \# of statistical tests increase, it may be better to control false discovery rate, rather than error rates.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{`The Bonferroni correction controls the familywise error rate..'} \protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{\emph{what is family wise error rate - See} Comments}
\item
  \emph{`..is not straight forward is that error control does not just aim to control the number of erroneous statistical inferences, but the number of erroneous theoretical inferences.'}. Is the author trying to say that corrections need to be done when a bunch of tests are trying to answer the same question, with a common dataset - don't fully understand
\item
  Experiment wise Type I error rates (\emph{I guess this is the famous p value?}) can be calculated from the setup of the stats? The example given by the author here is in a 2x2x2 ANOVA (See \protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{Comments 2}) - there are seven tests that are done, and so when a 0.05 \(\alpha\) is used each time, this make the probability of getting at least one effect at least 30\%. \emph{(\protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{Comments 3})}
\item
  The author also gives a more experimental example. The case of comparing predictions from two theories. One theory predicts interaction in a 2x2 ANOVA, and the other doesn't predict an interaction, but at least one main effect. (A 2x2 ANOVA tests 3 null hypotheses, two main effects and one interaction).\\
\item
  A naive way to approach the Bonferroni correction is to set the \(\alpha\) to \(\frac{\alpha}{3}\)
\item
  But here the author points out that because theoretically the two theories predict different outcomes, the \(\alpha\) also needs to corrected separately. Since Theory B predicts at least one significant main effect (out of 2 main effects) - we can set the new \(\alpha\) to \(\alpha /2\) and so if the p \textless{} \(\alpha/2\) we will accept Theory B
\item
  Since Theory A predicts only one interaction being significant, we don't really need to correct for anything. (\protect\hypertarget{lakens_com}{}{Comments 4})
\item
  Maintaining a sensible \(\alpha\) value with multiple testing corrections allows you to be wrong at most at the expected \(\alpha\) rate.
\item
  Should you correct for all the tests you will do over your lifetime? Yes, but only if all the data/work you've done is going into testing one single theory !
\item
  \emph{`..criticism on corrections for multiple comparisons is that it is strange that the conclusions a researcher draws depends on the number of additional tests a researcher performs.'} - here the authors cites the case of a 2 group comparison being significant at 0.05 (p=0.04), but when including a second dependent variable, the \(\alpha\) is now 0.025, which means the first variable data no longer rejects the null hypothesis. ..\emph{`Lowering alpha levels is a mathematical necessity when you want to control error rates, but it is not needed if ..you..quantify relative likelihoods of the data under different hypotheses.'}. Does the author mean that the comparison of the two groups for each of the dependent variables corresopnds to two independent null hypotheses? In what way is this different from the 2x2x2 ANOVA that was just discussed before?
\item
  You can also increase the alpha, and sometimes this makes sense to do so - ie. while pre-registering two studies, you can set the alpha at 0.2236, and decide that only if \emph{both} studies show \(p<0.2236\) will the null hypothesis be rejected. This is effectively the same as setting the overall \(p\) at 0.05 because 0.2236X0.2236 = 0.05 - {[}Comments 5{]}
\item
  \emph{`There is only one reason to calculate p-values, and that is to control Type 1 error rates using a Neyman-Pearson approach.'} - the focus here is on controlling false positives.

\item
  what is a `familywise error rate': The probability of making at least on Type I error (False Positive): \(FWE \leq 1-(1-\alpha_{test})^{Number\ of\ comparisons}\). eg. at an \(\alpha\) of 0.05 and with 10 tests, the \(FWE\) is : \(\leq (1-0.05)^{10}=0.401\) (thanks to this \href{https://www.statisticshowto.com/familywise-error-rate/}{page})
\item
  2x2x2 ANOVA is when there are three variables and two groups in each variable. ie. imagine you're testing a drugs efficacy, and you have three variables (Thanks to this \href{https://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/7/statistics/stat_what_is_three-way_anova_used_f.htm}{page}) : sex, dosage level and treatment/control. Within Sex there's male and female, within dosage level there's high and low, and then there's treatment/control. There are seven p-values because it performs a series of comparisons within the 2x2x2 complex:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    3 tests comparing the groups within each of the variables (eg. male vs female, treatment vs control, high vs low)
  \item
    3 tests testing two-way interactions: pool data from Sex, effect of treatment vs control in low and high dose groups
  \item
    1 test on three way interaction: \emph{`there is no three way interaction among all three factors'}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I get this example, within one statistical test, there are seven comparisons being made - and when each of these have an alpha value, there can be a false positive - what about when you are performing single comparisons of multiple variables from two groups?
\item
  I guess one of the main issues that the author is trying to bring out is that by naively correcting and setting \(\alpha\) values very low, we risk running into Type II (false negative) errors! By setting
\item
  What would have happened if the alpha was still set at 0.05 for both studies, then the effective false positive rate would have been 0.025 -- which is perhaps too conservative? Also, with an alpha set at 0.2236, the probability of a false negative is:

  Not clear what is meant by `limits to computational reproducibility' here.
\item
  Personally, I don't quite consider screenshot based records very reproducible, because they don't scale well with the number of steps. There are so many details to take care of often, and this is just a very cumbersome way to record and to read and try to reproduce an analysis.
\item
  Woah, even though the authors were relatively lax in their definition of what constitutes reproducible code -- even then just about one in three surveyed papers had the associated code with it.
\item
  Here too the authors have actually been generous with their criterion for what documentation actually is. I understand that most people will not have the time or training to document their code to the point where it is completely self-contained - but this is also the problem.
\item
  Another reason to avoid using proprietary software - it reduces the rate at which others can use your code \emph{and}, most importantly, excludes the quick replication of your results if someone wants to `fact check' it. In general, I can see how certain proprietary softwares may do the job well, but it also means it's an ivory tower - and no one can look into it. However, what can be done is to ensure a coomon set of coding standards are being followed nonetheless (code documentation, tests, READMEs, etc). I'm sure there must be a bigger discussion about this in the literature, as these are my first guesses/thoughts.

  The authors seemed to have used an automated tool to find their papers - `Rayyan' - interesting. This tool may be helpful in the future perhaps?!

\item
  This is a somewhat odd statement because \emph{any} statistical/analytical method cannot guarantee the detection of an effect. The ability of any stat/analytical method relies on so many things, the data, the sample size. On the other hand, even if a method `detects' something, there is no guarantee that it is not a false positive - which has no biological meaning. This is a somewhat odd statement especially because it seems to only focus on the false negative side of the story, and overly favours a positive statistical/analytical result. Taken independently, this sentence bothers me somewhat.
\item
  In Fig 1C the bat has many more dots than are numbered. Why were these dots not used in the final analysis, or discussed?
\item
  Only now we find out that the bat was actually placed on a platform and the setup was placed in front of it.
\item
  Wonder what the sensory consequences of this are? What happens \emph{after} the call? The echoes would typically return a few ms after the call - how fast are the pinnae responding to this, over what time-scales is the pinna motion actually happening.
\item
  In the introduction, the authors would like to test the hypothesis that noseleaf/pinna movements are important for biosonar performance. The prediction of noseleaf and pinna movements comes from nowhere - it is \emph{not} a prediction, but they are \emph{exploring} the connection!!! This is poor and misleading writing, which tries to fit a square into a triangle shaped hole. It's completely fine if the study is exploratory, but there is no need to sell it off as a study which comes from a theoretically based `prediction'

  `\emph{Every evening, from late spring to mid-summer, tens of thousands of hungry lactating female lesser long-nosed bats (}Leptonycteris yerbabuenae\emph{) emerge from their roost and navigate over the Sonoran Desert, seeking for nectar and pollen}' : Comment 2
\item
  Something I'm seeing in papers and am responding to. `We hypothesised..' without clearly stating the reason behind it.
\item
  \emph{..quality of a specific cactus can vary dramatically according to the number of flowers it opens on a given night} - somewhat misleading sentence. Comment 3
\item
  Fig 1A. - showing the number of open flowers per cacti - could have shown a \emph{discrete} colour bar. The use of a continuous color bar for integers is very confusing.
\item
  \emph{`Moreover, bats have to re-map the field every night.'} - not clear why, or what this statement is based on
\item
  \emph{Although we found a significant correlation between the number of flowers on consecutive nights, there was much inter-night variability} - the reference to the figures aren't v clear : Comment 4, 5
\item
  `\emph{\ldots because a conspecific might deplete it in the meanwhile (the bats' behaviour suggests they do not know whether a floewr was recently visited\ldots)}' -
  S1E captioned erroneously perhaps Comments 6,7
\item
  \emph{`Finally, all of these data were used to develop a mathematical model..'}, hmmm, this is a bit semantic, but aren't evolutionary simulations , \emph{simulations} and not `mathematical models' as such.
\item
  GPS tracked 17 bats, and then finally reconstructed the foraging sites of 8 bats. This must have been a lot of work over all! Perhaps, the authors even actually tagged more bats - and considering the problems with tag losses and animal recaptures - this must have been quite an effort.
\item
  Commuting speed was 8.7 m/s ground speed (\textasciitilde31km/h), and commutes correspond to \textasciitilde46\% of the time spent away from the cave
\item
  Even within a cactus field - each bat concentrated its foraging in a narrow part about 0.14 km\(^{2}\) in area (0.14 km\(^{2}\) is \textasciitilde{} 374x374 m\(^{2}\))
\item
  Plants that were visited \(\leq\) 5 times were considered to belong to the bats' `core cacti' - Comment 8
\item
  \emph{`Indeed, video analysis revealed that cacti with more flowers were visited significantly more often'} - this triggered the thought - do the authors actually report if bats visited multiple flowers per visit? This might be another way that bats learn to identify which cacti are worth visiting multiple times, and those which are not. Also did core cacti have more flowers than those around them?
\item
  In the reinforcement learning simulations, the bat remembers the top ten cacti it visited according to the amount of nectar it provided at that point of time (`nectar weight'). The next cactus to be visited is determined based on its nectar weight and inversely proportional to its distance from the current plant.
\item
  `\emph{Importantly, we did not fit the data in order to find the learning rate \(\alpha\)}' - this is not true. An evolutionary algorithm is one of many types of algorithms that can be used to estimate a parameter. All of these algorithms use some kind of minimisation/maximisation algorithm. An evolutionary algorithm just uses the fitness of the agent, which is in turn affected by the cost functions in the model itself. Moreover, the authors do use the actual data to parameterise the evolutionary simulations themselves. I don't see how the act of using an evolutionary algorithm means the parameter is not being fitted in the same way a common linear regression fits the data to get coefficients. This is logical wrong, and also misleading - adds an air of deeper sophistication than there actually is.
\item
  Authors show that when compared to a trapline model or a random search model, the reinforcement model matched various aspects of the observed dataset well (inter-visit distances, revisit time intervals)
\item
  Authors also ran simulations with aggressive behaviours in the agents, unlimited cacti memory (instead of a fixed 10 plants) - and still saw the appearance of non-overlapping core plants across multiple individuals
\item
  `\emph{We prove analystically that\ldots{}}' - missing reference to {[}29{]} (Korman et al.~2020, ArXiv preprint)
\item
  `\emph{Interestingly, a single-parameter model based on reinforcement learning was able to closely reproduce the bats' behavior}' - in some sense -- is this really a single-parameter model? The learning rate \(\alpha\) makes sense only in the context of the many other parameters that were used to setup the model right? Would the same learning rate be valid given that the bats flew at a different speed or the plants were placed at different spatial arrangements. This is not a fully generalisable result I feel\ldots.also isn't

\item
  The authors state \emph{`Many species have been suggestd to follow a trapline, that is, to revisit the food sources in a repeating ordered manner\ldots We thus hypothesized that lesser long-nosed bats would visit cacti in a sequenced manned.'}. Is this a legitimate form of hypothesising. Isn't it closer to expecting to \emph{examining}/checking if the bats perform sequenced foraging? Am wondering if this kind of formulation is the effect of the NHST type thinking, where there is one hypothesis that needs to be formulated and either rejected or supported.
\item
  Like it as an opening line. Very graphic, and very evocative of what is being studied. The sentence could have been shorter though.
\item
  The sentence creates the impression that quality is somehow influenced by the number of flowers open - as if they were \emph{two} variable. But instead, here, the authors actually define the \emph{quality} of a cactus by the number of flowers it has open!
\item
  Comment about figure S1 in general. This is a very compact graph, that prevent leisurely inspection of the data. Annother approach would have been to give one page to each graph and legend. This is the supplementary information section after all. (Does Current Biology have page limits even for this section?)
\item
  Figures S1C,D: it's not clear to me why the `independent model' looks the way it does. If there is no correlation at all between the last and current night there should be equal transition probability for any transition (0-10 flowers, 0-9, 1-10 etc..) - but here too there is some kind of clustering. Why is this the case - more details are required to explain the model. The explanation by itself is not detailed enough for criticism or replication.
\item
  S1E captioned `Bats probably cannot identify which flowers \emph{they} previously visted' - emphasis mine. - the caption refers to a bat knowing which flowers it previously visited while the main text refers to the idea that bats may not be able to tell if other conspecifics previously visited. Although in the following sentences the situation is corrected.
\item
  Figure S1F refers to the \emph{order} of visitation, and not really to whether bats can tell if a flower has been previously visited or not. This is confusing. Also S1F1,2 are incredibly small figures
\item
  The authors choose the points at which the derivative of the probability mass function (PMF) drops to zero. I'm thinking about how generalised this approach is. It works and it intuitively makes sense for \emph{this} particular PMF because the probability of increasing visits drops very drastically, and the distribution is right-skewed. The same definition would have failed if the PMF had been more flat, or bi-modal-ish. Another option would have been to use an X\% cumulative probability approach, ie. the \#of visits at which the X\%ile of the data is seen. This is robust to the exact shape of the distribution.
\item
  What kind of `cost function'/ metric was used. The exact parameterisation of this could have an effect of the types of decisions the agents end up showing.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In humans, the Lombard effect is known to occur at the sub-sentence level, and even at the sub-word level. Certains words in sentences were stressed more than others, and even parts of words themselves were stressed more than others.
\item
  So far, no work looking at whether animals can perform such similar sub-vocalisation amplitude compensation. Authors try to answer this question in two species of Hipposiderid bats.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  6 \emph{H. armiger} and 5 \emph{H. pratti} used in the study.
\item
  Like the fact that they authors state very clearly how they compensated the frequency response of the microphones and speakers.
\item
  Animals were placed on a roost with 15 microphones pointing to the animal above
\item
  Lowest received level recordable by the mics were 28 dB SPL rms (background noise level)
\item
  White noise between 10-100 kHz was played back at 3 levels:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    40, 52, 64 dB rms SPL
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fig.1 : Not clear where exactly the speaker was in relation to the bat. Fig 1. D makes it look like the speaker was placed to one side of the bat -- which is a somewhat odd position - given that there could be side biases or even side-filtering effects due to this.
\item
  Also played, bandpass or band-removed white noise
\item
  The `Call analysis' section - doesn't really `develop' a workflow beyond what is currently out in the published literature, neither is the code uploaded anywhere. Not sure why the authors claim to have `developed analytical tools to conduct automated sub-call level analyses.' as outlined in Fig S2 and the description istself. For instance, see \citep{siemers2005species} or \citep{schoeppler2018precise} - who use the same methodology.
\item
  The authors also don't really state how they are able to estimate the actual call levels of the call after having accounted for the noise playbacks.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors use a linear-mixed model and then report the estimated difference in received level in comparison to the silence - am wondering if this is too `processed' somehow. Does the story remain the same even if simple measures are used like the median? (this is a very crude thought!)
\item
  Bats seem to show an increase in FM amplitude when in the presence of any kind of noise - but especially strongly in the presence of 10-100 kHz noise.
\item
  tFM duration also seems to increase in \emph{H. armiger} by upto 0.6 ms - this increase is not negligible, considering the FM itself can be just a few ms long.
\item
  The bandwidth of the FM also seems to increase by a few kHz in the presence of increasing noise playback levels in \emph{H. armiger}
\item
  Against expectations, the authors also found that non-band noise playbacks resulted in a Lombard effect.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The description of the band-passed and band-removed noise playbacks is not very clear. It was good that the authors decided to put the schematic in Fig 4.
\item
  `..developed analytical tools to conduct automated sub-call level analyses.' - the code is sadly not uploaded anywhere online, and the authors state in the Call Analysis section `Original scripts for sound analysis of this study will be provided upon request.'. Also, the statement `All data needed to evaluate the conclusions are present in the paper or the Supplementary Materials.' is a bit of an oxymoron - this is the bare minimum that is required anyway. The next statement again points out to the whole idea of contacting the authors `Additional data related to this paper may be requested from the authors' - this step of contacting the authors only adds more hindrance to double checking work or using data for other purposes.
\item
  There seems to be some odd-ish self-citations in some places (only showing one here). For instance, \ldots{}`amplitude of mammals is largely determined by the subglottal air pressure' has a citation to Luo \& Wiegrebe 2016 - which actually studies another topic, and only mentions this same fact that amplitude is determined by subglottal air pressure. I find this citation
  out of place and unnecessary - as the paper itself is not a primary reference where this result has been determined or supported.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bats are known to handle complex environments and modulate their echolocation accordingly

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    beam shape, direction, pulse interval, call duration etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  `doublets' and `triplets' are known to be emited when there is clutter and thought to improve object resolution
\item
  Spatial memory however also plays a role in how bats echolocate. \emph{Eptesicus fuscus} reduce call rate and show an increasingly stable flight path as they fly over time in a fixed environment.
\item
  Bats may actually use their spatial memory to fly in challenging environments, and may not rely on the `actual' sensory feedback all the time. Authors designed a flight maze where bats didn't/had access to `sensory information' in terms of the extent to which echoes returned from obstacles.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bats had to fly in a `S' shaped flight path, the flight path was created with 2 types of walls: acoustically permeable and acoustically inpermeable.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The acoustically permeable wall was made of plastic chains hanging from the ceiling. It's considered acoustically permeable because the sound can pass through the gaps in the chains.
  \item
    the acoustically impermeable wall was made of boards.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  14 initially naive bats split into 7,7 between the two `treatments'

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    each bat was flown 12 times in the flight treatment, and the 1st and 12th flight trials were analysed - to observe changes.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{``If bats coordinate flight relying on their spatial memory rather than acoustic sensing, there would be no remarkable differences in the learned flight behaviours between the acoustically permeable wall and reflective wall conditions.''} . Not really. See Comments {[}1,2{]}
\item
  Beam direction estimated from the 20 mics placed all around the room. This is something I'm not so sure can be done accurately without mics on the obstacles themselves. Beam width can already be extremely narrow in horseshoe bats, and on top of that - an obstacle may shadow the beam a lot anyway -- and this might actually prevent detections of calls made in the direction of the obstacle itself! Comment {[}4{]}
\item
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{`Overall, the statistical models that we describe in the Methods and Materials section\ldots fit the data well and explain more variance than the respective null models with..'} - not really necessary, and not in context of any particular results
\item
  Bats actually emitted mostly doublets and triplets in both flight conditions

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Over time flying the setup, the numberof emitted calls and triplets fell in both treatments
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Authors \emph{do not} measure source level - which would have been a very important parameter to understand detection of echoes/obstacle avoidance
\item
  Faster flights had fewer calls emitted - (a sign that the bat is `bolder' and thus willing to take more sensorimotor risk somehow?)
\item
  Figure 5 c,d : the authors use a GLMM with 7 individuals, two treatmetns, measured twice. Is there enough power in there to detect differences given the sampling intensity?
\item

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The target strengths of the `acoustically permeable' and impermeable treatments are by their very nature different. This means that the two walls will be detected at different distances/ the reflected echoes will have a much higher received level. The received level being higher in one treatment than the other itself may cause all kinds of different responses. How to control for this. Perhaps the bats are not really `using' the echoes of the objects behind but rather relying only on the received level of the echoes?
\item
  One of the other things the authors could have done to control for the difference in target strengths is to make impermeable chain walls or permeable acrylic sheet walls. This would remove aspects such as directionality of the object -- even though it might actually be really hard to equalise target strength.
\item
  No DATA or CODE published online.
\item
  The authors also state a previous publication to show that the beam shape direction can be accurately recreated - but this is with the same/similar microphone arrangement \emph{without} obstacles

  \emph{'Echolocation is still a topic that resists neat classification into any conventional category of science. It ramifies into widely different scientific disciplines iunclusing ethology, mammalogy, physiology, psychology, acoustics, nd the mathematical theory of signal detectionl. The results of new investigations have reemphasized the necessity of a broad biological perspective for any serious appreciation of echolocation. }
\item
  page 58: about Spallanzi's work \emph{`Yet only a regrettably small propotion of his obserations and conclusions became widely enough known to win any general acceptance among zoologists, and even today much of his work remains unpublished.What is known of it serves amply to confirm the proposition that one can often learn more from a careful study of the thoughts of a master than from years of firsthand research.'}

  `The apparatus then in use by Pierce was called a sonic detector, and it consisted of a crystal microphone located at the focus of a long parabolic horn, cacuum tube amplifiers to increase the minute electrical votages generated by such a crystal when ssound waves impinge upon it, and circuit \ldots.'
\item
  page 80: `And finally, just what can bats perceive by echolocation, how close must objects of various sizes be before they can be detected, under what conditions does echolocation perhaps fail to serve bats as well as in our laboratory tests, and how do dozens or hundreds of bats manage to fly in the same part of a cave without interfering with each other's acoustic orientation?'
\item
  page 85: `Until very recently only one reliable type of microphone has been available which could be calibrated over the frequency range required to study bat sounds, that is\ldots.'
\item
  page 166: `Echolocation cannot be an easy or an automatic process for the bats; it must require attention, skill, and metnal effort, albeit perhaps wholly unconscious effort like that involved in walking through underbrush or riding a bicycle.'
\item
  page 166: `Evidently when bats are flying through familiar surroundings they rely to an increasing extent on their memory of spatial relations acquired on previous flights through the same space.'
\item
  page 180, chp 7: `There were a few practical difficulties standing in the way of this objective. Microphone, pre-amplifier, and portable raio could all be operated from dry batteries, and indeed my original apparatus for listening to bat sounds during their pursuit ofinsects was all carried in a single box strapped to my back by means of a rucksack frame. A cathode ray oscillograph was something else again, but a small one could be operated from a storage batter therough a vibrator which acted as a converter of direct to alternating current.'
\item
  page 181, chp 7: `Finally after several evenings of hectic preparations and gradual elimination of operating difficulties, I was ready with the microphone and parabolic horn now mounted on a bracket not unlike a tommy gun, the trigger bying a swirch for remote control of the motion picture camera which was to photograph the oscillograph screen.'
\item
  page 201, Chp 7: `This presented certain difficulties, for people are prone to wonder when a man walks about wearing ear phones connected to a box with dials, and carries in his hand a parabolic horn. Various explanations were suggested quite audibly, but the onlookers seldom noticed the bats though we were pointing the horn toward them at every opportunity. When one youth suggested to his companions that we might be listening to the bats he was derided and drowned out with knowing statements about radio receivers and cosmic rays.'
\item
  page 367, Chp 14: `To be sure, background noises at ultrasonic frequencies are nto of nearly so great marnitude as sounds of lower frequencies resultring from natural causes such as rustling of begetation by the wind, insect sounds, or the noise produced by running water. But other bats must be a major source of possible interference, and it is only natural to wonder why the many bats whichfly in a single cave do not ``jam'' each other since each one is busy filling the air with its won pulses.'
\item
  page 386 Chp 15: `A little of the naturalis'ts viewpoint is required to comprehend more fully the significance and the boundless variety of precisely adapted functional microcosms among which we live. But it is even more obvious in this period of scientific history that we can no longer expect to understand nature by merely describing and cataloging her variety. We now have tools at our disposal which can help us to deeper and more satisfying insights. It is in this context that I hope the phenomena of echolcoation will be contemplated, so that they may serve to exemplify the potential role of an analytical approach to natural history.'

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{notes taken on 2020-11-23} (first attempt at reading and making notes for a German paper)
\item
  authors start by stating that many long-distance orientation behaviours are often driven by unknown senses. Studying short range orientation could provide support.
\item
  Experiments done on \emph{Rhinolophus ferrumequinum} and \emph{Myotis myotis}.
\item
  Many short and long-range orientation bheaviours are driven by the same sensory systems - even though they may predominate differently in each behavioural context.
\item
  Authors exploit the fact that bats get used to roosting in spot - which can be a cage. They can be made to fly out of the cage by letting out an insect, and then their flight trajectories can be studied over time.
\item
  The authors make a valid point that closed spaces like flight rooms are indeed very similar to bats' natural environments, as caves are essentially closed spaces.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{experiments}{%
\section{Experiments}\label{experiments}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Authors released bats from a cage to capture insects. They turned the cage door 90degrees to another side while the bat was capturing the insect and observed what the bat actualy did. They found that most of the time the bats constantly attempted to enter the `wrong' side of the cage - even though they could detect the fact that the current cage surface did not have an opening.
\item
  Moving and turning the whole cage in the flight room never affected the return flights, as long as the door direction was kept the same
\item
  The authors also began dismantling the cage gradually until there nothing of it anymore. Even then, the bats constantly seemed to return to an imaginary cage and even try to `hang' from an imaginary ceiling of the cage.
\item
  Authors also noticed that bats seemed to constantly search for insects in the `usually' kept places first - and then only look elsewhere.
\item
  Authors also had a section of the room that was initially inaccessible, and then made accessible. The bats did not fly easily into the part of the room that was later made accessible. Bats always in flew in gradually increasing inward flights, while always returning to their familiar volume.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors suggest that bats may use echolocation to first form their impressions of the volume they are flying in.
\item
  They state it's not possible to directly infer how bats can orient so well in space.
\item
  They also discuss the possibility of bats reducing/reducing their dependence of echolocation as they gain familiarity with a space they are flying in.
